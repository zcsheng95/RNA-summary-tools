getPIcounts             getPIcounts Extract counting bases summary from
                        PICARD output
getSTARcounts           getSTARcounts Extract strand-specific STAR
                        counts for each sample and then merge all
                        counts into a single table
getSTARsum              getSTARsum Produce a summary table for STAR
                        alignment process
logCombine              logCombine It combines log columns of different
                        samples
myPidfile               myPidfile get picard '.metrics' files from root
                        directory
myrcpp                  myrcpp The function illustrates how to use
                        RcppEigen to fit the model Y = X beta + epsilon
                        What is returned is the vector
                        betahat=LSE(beta)
mystarLogfile           mystarLogfile Generates the full path to a STAR
                        log file. It assume that the log file is of the
                        form rootdir/stardir/suffix
mystarfile              mystarfile Generates the full path to a STAR
                        count file. It assume that the count file is of
                        the form rootdir/stardir/suffix
picardCombine           picardCombine Row bind of picard summary for
                        df1 and df2
plotAlignment           plotAlignment Plot stacked barplot for bases
                        counting proportion for STAR and PICARD
printab                 printab Print summary table in LaTex format
sanitize_text           sanitize_text Sanitize LaTex table output from
                        xtable
sumHTSeq                sumHTSeq Helper function that makes adjustments
                        to output from getSTARcounts to be ready for
                        plotting
